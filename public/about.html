<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Passionate about the convergence of law and technology, I am currently pursuing a three-year computing and law degree. I possess a keen interest in Data/Business Analytics, Risk Governance, FinTech, Legal Tech, UI/UX, and Business Process, and aim to delve into these dynamic intersections. Drawing from my experience in event planning and sales, technology pre-sales and consumer research as well are also areas that I would like to build my skillsets towards.</p>

<p>I like watching Isekai Anime. I'm currently watching "My Isekai Life: I Gained a Second Class Character Class and Became the Strongest Sage in the World"</p>
