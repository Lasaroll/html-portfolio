<h1>The Best Series According to Lydia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Series of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Blue Whisper</h3>
<p>I like Dilraba Dilmurat and Mermaids and characters who never die no matter how many times they seemed to be eliminated </p>
<h3>Arifureta </h3>
<p> When it comes to anime, I like it when the main character is extremely strong even though he was once weak</p>
<h3>King's Affection</h3>
<p>The ending was satisfying, worth hanging there for</p>
